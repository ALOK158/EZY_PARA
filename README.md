Abstract Sentence Classification using NLP

Overview

This repository contains an NLP model designed to classify sentences in research abstracts into predefined categories such as Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusion, etc. The goal is to help researchers quickly skim through literature and dive deeper when necessary. The model is trained on the SkimLit dataset.

Dataset: SkimLit

SkimLit is a dataset specifically designed for scientific literature classification, containing labeled sentences from biomedical abstracts. Each sentence is categorized based on the role it plays in the abstract, making it ideal for training models that facilitate automatic summarization and information extraction.

Features

Pre-trained NLP model for classifying abstract sentences

Multi-class classification for different sections of abstracts

BERT-based model architecture for state-of-the-art text classification performance

Fine-tuned on the SkimLit dataset to improve accuracy

Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/skimlit-nlp.git
cd skimlit-nlp
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the following command to classify sentences in research abstracts:

python classify.py --input "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of drug X."

Example Output:

Category: Objective

Model Architecture

The model is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and fine-tuned on the SkimLit dataset. It uses:

Tokenization and embedding layers from Hugging Face's Transformers

Fine-tuning with PyTorch/TensorFlow

Classification layers optimized for text classification tasks

Training

To train the model on the SkimLit dataset:

python train.py --epochs 5 --batch_size 16

This will fine-tune the model and save the best weights.

Evaluation

Run the evaluation script to measure the model's performance:

python evaluate.py

Expected Metrics:

Accuracy

F1 Score

Precision & Recall

Applications

Scientific Paper Summarization: Quickly understand research papers by analyzing key sections.

AI-powered Literature Review: Automate literature reviews by filtering and highlighting important content.

Academic Search Engines: Enhance academic search tools by categorizing abstract information efficiently.
